	- added :utils export option for all functions.
	- added documentation for export functions.
	- added examples/utils.pl.
	- added new function "formatForms" (like sprintf for syllables).
	- added the "o" optimizer everywhere applicable,
	  lets hope this doesn't break anything.
	- Changed \p{InEthiopic} to \p{Ethiopic} which (I think) will
	  match only Ethiopic letter chars.

0.10 Mon May19 12:33:39 EDT 2003
	- fixed "subForm" export problem in Regexp::Ethiopic::Amharic,
	  an oversite from the 0.09 release.

0.09 Sun May 18 05:12:46 EDT 2003
	- addition of "subForm".

0.08 Sat Apr 19 11:50:38 EDT 2003
	- tweaked RE language so that the % operator must appear inside {}.
          Which is a simplification for interpretation, %'s scope as an operator
          is now restricted, this should fit in with traditional REs more readily.

	- a one char doc fix.

0.05 Fri Apr 11 17:07:07 EDT 2003
	- added exportable getForm and setForm which I keep using in
	  other packages.
	- Exportable ":forms" added which exports a list of classic variable
	  names for the Ethiopic letter forms and their numeric value.
	- fixed examples at end of examples/overload.pl
	- documentation fixes.
